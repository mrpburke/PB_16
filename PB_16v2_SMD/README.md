# PB 16v2

The PB 16v2 is a surface mount(SMD) version of the original PB16. The updated PB 16v2 has 16 local pixel ports, one remote receiver port(4 remote ports), a 16 port expansion, and 2 serial ports. A total of 36 pixel outputs. All the design files are open source and available on github.

### Features
* Powered by FPP Falcon Player
* Standalone/Master/Remote/Bridge Support
* 16 3-Wire Pixel Ports
* 1 RJ-45 Connector for a remote differential port.
* 700 pixel per output at 40 FPS or 1300 at 20 FPS
* 2 DMX Serial Outputs
* 1 RJ-45 Connectors with DMX/LOR Wiring Support
* Fused Powered DMX Output
* USB port for Ethernet,WIFI, or Audio
* OLED Display header
* Adafruit Real Time Clock Header Connector
* 2 pin GPIO Header for Push Button or Relay Support
* 5v - 24v Vin Support
* Expansion Header for additional 16 pixel outputs, Supports Falcon(v3) Expansion Boards
