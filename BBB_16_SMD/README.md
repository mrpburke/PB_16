# BBB 16 SMD

**WIP** Proceed at your own risk.

The BBB 16 SMD is a Surface Mount(SMD) BeagleBone Version with 16 pixel ports, 1 remote differential port, 2 serial ports, and an expansion header for additional 16 pixel outputs. Uses Falcon v4 (24 pin) Expansion Pinout.

**Warning** Due to part shortages, I have switched this design(v3) to use 3.81mm Phoenix Connectors for the string ports. Most other controllers (Falcon, Kulps) use 3.50mm Phoenix Connectors and the plugs are not compatible. The PCB footprints can accept both 3.81mm and 3.50mm headers, but the parts in the BOM are 3.81mm at the moment. 

To order PCBs upload the ["GERBER-BBB_16.zip"](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/raw/master/BBB_16_SMD/jlcpcb/gerber/GERBER-BBB_16.zip) file in the "jlcpcb\gerber" folder to jlcpcb.com. Enable the SMD service, 'BOM-BBB_16.csv' is the SMD BOM and 'POS-BBB_16.csv' is the SMD CPL position file.
