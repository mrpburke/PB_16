# PB 16 E682

**This is a proof of concept, not designed for extended use**

The PB16 E682 is an "Upgrade" for the Sandevice E682. The E682's Parallax Propeller microcontroller is replaced with a PocketBeagle runnig FPP. It runs a full Linux operating system with ethernet, WIFI and audio supported over the USB port. The PCB is powered by the Aux Power Connector J17 5V out from the E682. It can run in standalone, or be used with other controllers/devices. There is also an optional [serial breakout board](../PB_16_E682_Serial/README.md) for DMX capability. All the design files are open source and available on github.
