# Receiver Out SMD

The "Receiver Out SMD" is a 4 port Differental Reciver output board for the PB16. This design is surface mount based and is harder to solder. All the design files are open source and available on github.

To order PCBs upload the "GERBER-Receiver_Out.zip" file in the "jlcpcb\gerber" folder. Enable the SMD service, 'BOM-Receiver_Out.csv' is the SMD BOM and 'POS-Receiver_Out.csv' is the SMD CPL position file.
