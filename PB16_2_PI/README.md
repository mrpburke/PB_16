# PB16-2-PI

This is an adapter to use a Raspberry Pi W with the PB16 Cape instead of a PocketBeagle. This only supports tje 16 local ports and the serial ports. The Expansion header does not work. Open source applications were used to create this PCB. [KiCad](http://kicad.org/) was used for the PCB design, and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for the documentation.

To order your own PCB upload the gerber.zip file to your favorite PCB manufacture of choice, I personally use [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).
